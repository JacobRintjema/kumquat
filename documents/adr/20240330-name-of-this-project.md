# Name of this Project

- Status: accepted
- Deciders: James Dobson, Amir Bavand


## Context and Problem Statement

This project needs a name. We initially called it "Shipyard" but it turns out that name is already taken:

- https://shipyard.build/
- https://shipyard.run/



## Decision Drivers

- Meaningful name
- Concise
- Unique
- Desire to Open Source
- Easy to type



## Considered Options

- Option 1: Keep Using Shipyard
- Option 2: Another Star Trek Name
- Option 3: Descriptive Name


### Option 1: Keep Using Shipyard

We can keep using the name "Shipyard" even though it is already used by other projects.


### Option 2: Another Star Trek Name

There are other options from the Star Trek universe we could use:
- Utopia Planitia


### Option 3: Descriptive Name

We could use a name that describes what it does.

For example, it queries Kubernetes resources and then instatiates new resources. So we could call it something
like "kweryput": it "queries" "K"ubernetes resources and then it "puts" new resources.

What options for the second verb are there?

- plonk
- plunk
- plop
- push
- post
- splat
- tpl or tmpl (kwerytpl or kwerytmpl)

Other ideas for names that describe what it does:

- kontemplation


### Option 4: Another Interesting Word

- pylon
- kumon
- kumquat - could stand for "KUbernetes Metacontroller QUery And Template"
- kroquet
- kuque (like tuque)



## Decision Outcome

Let's go for *kumquat*. It could potentially stand for "KUbernetes Metacontroller QUery And Template."


### Positive Consequences

- It's relatively easy to type.
- No confusion: googling "kumquat kubernetes" doesn't have any meaningful hits.
- We can probably get a cute logo (kumquat with googly cartoon eyes).

### Negative Consequences

- It's not descriptive; nobody will know what the project does just by hearing its name.
